🚀 Cloud Cost Prediction & Idle Resource Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Cloud infrastructure platforms dynamically allocate computing resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. However, inefficient provisioning and underutilized instances often lead to unnecessary operational expenditure.

This project presents a Machine Learning-based analytical framework that:

Predicts monthly cloud infrastructure cost

Detects idle cloud resources

Estimates potential cost savings

Provides a scalable foundation for intelligent cloud optimization

The predictive core of the system has been implemented and validated.

🎯 Problem Statement

Inefficient cloud resource allocation and idle infrastructure generate unnecessary operational costs, requiring an intelligent system to predict billing expenditure and identify underutilized resources.

🎯 Objectives

Develop a regression model to predict monthly cloud billing cost

Build a classification model to detect idle resources

Evaluate performance using statistical metrics

Estimate potential cost savings through optimization
