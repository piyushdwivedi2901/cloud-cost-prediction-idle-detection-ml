# 🚀 Cloud Cost Prediction & Idle Resource Detection Using Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Cloud infrastructure platforms dynamically allocate computing resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. Inefficient provisioning and underutilized instances often lead to unnecessary operational expenditure.

This project presents a **Machine Learning-based analytical framework** that:

- Predicts monthly cloud infrastructure cost  
- Detects idle cloud resources  
- Estimates potential cost savings  
- Provides a scalable foundation for intelligent cloud optimization  

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Inefficient cloud resource allocation and idle infrastructure generate unnecessary operational costs, requiring an intelligent system to predict billing expenditure and identify underutilized resources.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a regression model to predict monthly cloud billing cost  
- Build a classification model to detect idle resources  
- Evaluate performance using statistical metrics  
- Estimate potential cost savings through optimization  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

A structured cloud workload dataset containing **2000 records** was generated to simulate enterprise-level billing logs.
